# ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Execution Guide

## üéØ Overview
AutoML-Insight now supports **smart execution mode selection** with automatic recommendations based on your dataset size and available resources.

---

## ‚ú® Features

### 1. **Automatic Resource Detection**
- Detects available RAM, CPU cores, GPU
- Calculates required memory for your dataset
- Recommends best execution mode (local vs cloud)

### 2. **Smart Recommendations**
```
Dataset: 150,000 √ó 361,000 features
Required Memory: ~403 GB
Available RAM: 8 GB

‚ùå Cannot run locally
‚úÖ Recommend: Cloud execution (Colab/Kaggle)
```

### 3. **Two Execution Modes**

#### üñ•Ô∏è **Local Machine**
- Runs directly on your computer
- Best for small/medium datasets (< 10GB RAM required)
- Immediate results
- Uses smart feature selection (1000-5000 features)

#### ‚òÅÔ∏è **Cloud (Colab/Kaggle)**
- Generates ready-to-use Jupyter notebook
- Upload to Google Colab (free GPU, 12 GB RAM)
- Or Kaggle (free GPU, 30 GB RAM)
- Can handle larger datasets (up to 10,000 features)
- Download results and upload back to app

## üìã How to Use

### **Option 1: Local Execution** (Small Datasets)

1. Upload your CSV file
2. Select task type and target column
3. App will show: ‚úÖ "Your machine can handle this dataset"
4. Choose "üñ•Ô∏è Local Machine"
5. Click "üöÄ Run AutoML Locally"
6. Wait for results

### **Option 2: Cloud Execution** (Large Datasets)

1. Upload your CSV file
2. App shows: ‚ö†Ô∏è "Dataset needs 50 GB but only 8 GB available. Recommend cloud."
3. Choose "‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud (Colab/Kaggle)"
4. Click "üìì Generate Cloud Notebook"
5. Download the generated notebook
6. Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)
7. Upload notebook (File ‚Üí Upload notebook)
8. Enable GPU (Runtime ‚Üí Change runtime type ‚Üí GPU)
9. Run all cells (Runtime ‚Üí Run all)
10. Upload your CSV when prompted
11. Wait for training (5-30 minutes)
12. Download `automl_results.json`
13. Back in AutoML-Insight app, upload the results file
14. View results in dashboard!

## üîß Configuration

### Feature Selection Limits

**Local Mode:**
- 8 GB RAM ‚Üí 1,000 features max
- 16 GB RAM ‚Üí 2,000 features max
- 32+ GB RAM ‚Üí 5,000 features max

**Cloud Mode:**
- Google Colab (12 GB RAM) ‚Üí 5,000 features
- Kaggle (30 GB RAM) ‚Üí 10,000 features

### Customize

Edit `core/preprocess.py` line 17:
```python
def __init__(self, max_features: int = 1000):  # Change this number
```

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Start Local**: Try local execution first, even if warned. Feature selection might make it work!

2. **Use Cloud for**:
   - > 100,000 samples
   - > 1,000 features  
   - Need GPU acceleration

3. **Feature Selection**:
   - Automatically keeps most important features
   - Uses correlation with target variable
   - No accuracy loss for most datasets

4. **Cloud Benefits**:
   - Free GPU (10x faster for XGBoost, deep learning)
   - More RAM (12-30 GB vs typical 8 GB)
   - Can run longer experiments

## üéì Example Workflows

### Small Dataset (Iris - 150 √ó 4)
- ‚úÖ Run locally
- Completes in < 1 minute
- All features used

### Medium Dataset (10,000 √ó 100)
- ‚úÖ Run locally  
- Feature selection: 100 ‚Üí 100 (keeps all)
- Completes in 2-5 minutes

### Large Dataset (150,000 √ó 361,000)
- ‚ùå Cannot run locally (403 GB required)
- ‚úÖ Use cloud execution
- Feature selection: 361,000 ‚Üí 5,000
- Completes in 10-20 minutes on Colab GPU

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Out of memory" error locally
- Switch to cloud mode
- Or reduce `max_features` in preprocess.py

### Cloud notebook fails
- Check you enabled GPU in Colab
- Ensure you uploaded CSV file
- Check target column name matches

### Results upload fails
- Ensure file is `automl_results.json`
- File must come from the generated notebook
- Check JSON format is valid
